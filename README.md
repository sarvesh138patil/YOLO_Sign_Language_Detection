# YOLO_Sign_Language_Detection

🔎 Object Detection Magic: I employed YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to build a system that can spot sign language with incredible accuracy

🎯 Impressive Results: After lots of training, fine-tuning, and playing with parameters, I achieved impressive results!

⭐ Supercharged Training: I trained the model using the powerful combination of YOLOv5 version 7.0, Python 3.10.12, Torch 2.6.0+cu124, and a Tesla T4 GPU. It was a high-octane training session!

🔥 Hyperparameter Wizardry: I carefully selected the perfect hyperparameters for optimal performance. The model underwent 100 intense epochs, with images of size 416x416 and a batch size of 16. It's all about finding that sweet spot!

🧪 Torch & Python Magic: Thanks to the remarkable Torch library and Python wizardry, I brought the YOLOv5 architecture to life. The model had a whopping 233 layers and a grand total of 7,322,519 parameters. That's some serious firepower!

🔗 Open-Source Love: I leveraged the awesome YOLOv5 GitHub repository.

🏆 Validation Glory: During the validation phase, my model showed off its skills. It achieved a stunning overall mAP50 (mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50) score of 0.952. Talk about precision!
